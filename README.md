A soft monospace (or proportional!) variable font by [ty](https://tyfromtheinternet.com)

![Sample of Sono Family.](animated-sono.gif "animated sono")

Seven weights: ExtraLight through ExtraBold. Sono Sans is proportional width glyphs/spacing with kerning. Sono is fixed-width (and obviously not kerned). Variable version (mono, wght) works in Figma üëç
